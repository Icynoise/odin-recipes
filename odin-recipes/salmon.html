    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This grilled salmon tastes so good! A simple soy sauce and brown sugar marinade, with hints of lemon and garlic, are the perfect salty-sweet complement to rich salmon fillets. Even my 9-year-old loves this recipe!</p>

        <li>1 ½ pounds salmon fillets</li>
        <li>lemon pepper to taste</li>

        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
