    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For this satisfying sarma dish, cabbage leaves are stuffed with a seasoned mixture of rice, ground beef, pork, and ham. They are then laid on a bed of sauerkraut and simmered to completion. This is the best stuffed cabbage recipe I've ever tried.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground ham</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 pound sauerkraut</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato juice</li>
        <li>1 cup water, or as needed to cover</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the leaves from the head of cabbage.</li>
        <li>Mix beef, pork, ham, uncooked rice, onion, egg, salt, pepper, and garlic powder together in a bowl until well combined. Form mixture into oblong balls, using 1/2 cup of the mixture at a time. Wrap a cabbage leaf around each ball.</li>
        <li>Spread sauerkraut in the bottom of a large pot. Layer cabbage rolls on top, placing them seam-side down. Pour tomato juice over rolls, then add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 3 hours, adding more water as necessary.</li>
    </ol>
